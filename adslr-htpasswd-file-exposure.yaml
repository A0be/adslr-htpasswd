    Detects exposure of the .htpasswd file, which may contain sensitive information such as usernames and hashed passwords. This can lead to unauthorized access if the file is publicly accessible.
  remediation: |
    Ensure that sensitive files like .htpasswd are not served by the web server. Configure the server to deny access to these files by updating the server configuration to restrict access.
